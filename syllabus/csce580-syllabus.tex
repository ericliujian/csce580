\section*{Course Description}

When we talk about Machine Learning (ML), we typically refer to a technique or an algorithm that gives the computer systems the ability to learn and to reason with data. However, there is a lot more to ML than just implementing an algorithm or a technique. In this course, we will learn the fundamental differences between ML as a technique versus ML as a system in production. A machine learning system involves a significant number of components and it is important that they remain responsive in the face of failure and changes in load. This course covers several strategies to keep ML systems responsive, resilient, and elastic. Machine learning systems are different than other computer systems when it comes to building, testing, deploying, delivering, and evolving. ML systems also have unique challenges when we need to change the architecture or behavior of the system. Therefore, it is essential to learn how to deal with such unique challenges that only may happen when building real-world production-ready ML systems (e.g., performance issues, memory leaking, communication issues, multi-GPU issues, etc). The focus of this course will be primarily on \textbf{deep learning systems}, but the principles will remain similar across all ML systems. 




\section*{Learning Outcomes}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain differences between ML as predictive technique and as a computer system.

\item Describe how a distributed ML system works in production and insight into challenges.

\item Locate technical debt in building ML systems.

\item Employ design strategies and best practices to mitigate technical debt.

\item Incorporate ML-based components into a larger system.

% \item Understand how to build a system that can put the power of machine learning to use.

\item State the principles that govern ML systems.

\item Build systems that are more capable, both as software and as predictive systems.

\item Identify systems issues and apply strategies to avoid them in production ML systems.

\end{enumerate}


\section*{Course Syllabi}

In this course, we will understand central principles of \textbf{machine learning systems}. We will begin by reviewing common challenges and technical debt that may incur massive ongoing maintenance costs in real-world ML systems. We explore several ML-specific risk factors to account for in system design. These include boundary erosion, entanglement, hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, configuration issues, changes in the external world, and a variety of system-level anti-patterns. We will review many different examples of real-world ML systems and the unique challenges one may encounter to integrate a research ML technique into a production-ready system. We will review unique challenges relevant to each component of an ML system from data collection, feature generation, model learning, model evaluation, model publishing, and acting on the real-world. 

In this course, we will also study strategies and principles of distributed ML especially for handling big data in modern production systems. We will learn how to build distributed Deep Learning systems using computer systems best practices. We will study design solutions in ML systems to make them as reliable as a production-ready software system. We will also review design patterns to implement and coordinate ML subsystems. Using powerful frameworks such as Spark, MLlib, Clipper, and Akka, you will learn how to quickly and reliably move from a single machine to a massive cluster. We will then proceed how one can operate a large-scale ML system over time. We will employ the computer systems principles to build ML applications that are responsive, resilient, and elastic. In this course, students will gain hands-on experience applying systems principles to implement scalable learning pipelines. We will also cover various aspects of learning systems, including: automatic differentiation, distributed learning, and scalable model serving. We will finally review best practices of ML at scale in Uber, Spotify, Netflix. 


\section*{Course Projects and Homeworks}

For the course projects/homeworks, students will work on some aspects of distributed ML systems. The details of the projects will become available, but they will be mainly around identifying systems issues in open-source ML systems by looking into GitHub repositories and providing solutions for fixing the issues, building a new model serving system, contributing for a new feature for the following frameworks and engines (essentially something cool either an empirical study or developing a feature):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Front-end (Keras, Caffe2), backend engines (Tensorflow, PyTorch, Theano, CNTK, MXNet), and Interoperability tools (Apache ONNX).
\item Modern data architecture patterns for handling big data in ML systems (MapReduce).
\item Configuration and Resource Management, distributed ML engines (Apache Spark), Model Serving Infrastructure (TF serving, Clipper).
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Prerequisites}

Familiarity with Python or C/C++: we will mainly be using python for the course projects, and C/C++ may be handy for some of the background hacking.


\section*{Readings}

\begin{itemize}
\item Jeff Smith, Reactive Machine Learning Systems, MEAP, 2018.
\item Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville, \href{http://www.deeplearningbook.org/}{Deep Learning}, MIT Press, 2016.
\end{itemize} 


\section*{Course Policy}

I will detail the policy for this course below. Basically, don't cheat and try to learn stuff.

\subsection*{Attendance and class participation}
Attendance is essential for success in this course. We encourage students to ask questions and your active participation (by asking or answering questions, sharing experience, discussing project ideas, etc) in this course will enhance your learning experience and that of the other students.

\subsection*{Grading Policy}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \underline{\textbf{10\%}} of your grade will be determined by your attendance and participation in class. Generally, ask questions and answer them.

  \item \underline{\textbf{60\%}} of your grade will be determined by the course project. There will be only one project per team of students which will be formed in the first 3 weeks. Each team will be working on their own project throughout the semester and they will present/demo their work at the end of semester. The grade will be per student depending on her/his contribution to the project, progress throughout the semester, and the quality of the final presentation. 

  \item \underline{\textbf{30\%}} of your grade will be determined by courseworks/homeworks throughout the semester. Homeworks are assignments/quizzes need to be delivered in 1-2 weeks, so students do these assignments regularly throughout the semester.

\end{itemize}

The grading scale: A = 90 to 100, B = 80 to 89, C = 70 to 79, D = 60 to 69, F <= 59.

The final exam will be Tuesday, December 11, at 4:00pm in SWGN 2A24.


\subsection*{Academic Integrity}

I would encourage you to discuss or brainstorm with other students or professors, but be aware if you copy/paste from other students/Internet, you will simply fail this course. All the potential Honor Code violations will be reported to the Office of Academic Integrity, which has the authority to implement non-academic penalties as described in STAF 6.25 (\url{http://www.sc.edu/policies/ppm/staf625.pdf}).

\subsection*{Disabilities Policy}

Any student who has a need for accommodation based on the impact of
a documented disability, please contact the Office of Student Disability Services: Phone: 803-777-6142, Email: \textit{sasds@mailbox.sc.edu}, Address: 1523 Greene Street, LeConte College Room 112A, Web: \url{https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_disability_resource_center/index.php}.
