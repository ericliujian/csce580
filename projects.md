## Released Projects

### [P0: UNIX/Python Tutorial](https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/csce580/projects/project0/)
This short UNIX/Python tutorial introduces students to the [Python](http://www.python.org/) programming language and the UNIX environment.


## Technical Notes
The Pac-Man projects are written in pure Python 3.6 and do not depend on any packages external to a standard Python distribution.

## Credits
The Pacman AI projects were developed at UC Berkeley. The core projects and autograders were primarily created by John DeNero and Dan Klein. Student side autograding was added by Brad Miller, Nick Hay, and Pieter Abbeel. We thank them for their permission to use it as a part of this course.
