Learning Goals:
* Underestanding classical as well as recently discovered methods in AI, and explore their potential applications. 
* Building AI systems that autonomously make decision and act not only in fully informed environments, but also in partially observable and adversarial contexts. 
* Building AI systems that make probabilistic inferences in uncertain and dynamic environments.
